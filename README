HW/SW Codesign - build environment
----------------------------------

This is the demo project of the HW/SW build environment. It should contain the 
following files and directories.

  |- quartus
     |- Makefile
     |- .qpf .qsf
     |- .qsys
     |- .sdc
     |- qsyscores
       |- .tcl                   your QSYS TCL scripts (custom cores) go here
  |- software
     |- Makefile

     |- settings.bsp
     |- src                       your C code goes here
  |- vhdl                         your VHDL code goes here
  |- Makefile                     master Makefile
  |- README

The hardware project is located in the ./quartus directory. The Makefile in this
directory provides the following targets:

make              runs quartus synthesis (this includes the qsys system 
                  generation) 
make download     downloads the sof file to the board
make quartus_gui  starts the quartus GUI and loads the quartus project
make qsys_gui     starts the qsys GUI and loads the qsys project
make clean        deletes all files, which are generated during the build
                  process. REMEMBER to clean your project before submission!!

Note that you can also start the synthesis and download process using the 
quartus GUI.


The software project is located in the ./software directory. The makefile and 
shell-script in this folder build the bsp- and application project. The makefile 
provides the following targets:

make            creates bsp and app makefile (if necessary) and creates the elf 
                file. No download is performed.
make download   downloads the elf file to the nios2 processor
make term       starts the nios2-terminal (jtag uart) and connects to the nios2
                processor
make edit_bsp   opens the bsp settings GUI editor (settings.bsp)
make run        builds and downloads elf file and starts nios2-terminal 
                (jtag uart)
make clean      deletes all files, which are generated during the build
                process. REMEMBER to clean your project before submission!!

All your C source/header files MUST be placed in the ./software/src directory.

IMPORTANT:
You have to run "make" in the software folder from the nios2_command_shell, 
otherwise an error will be raised. To execute the nios2_command_shell run 
/path/to/altera_dir/nios2eds/nios2_command_shell.sh.
To find the path to the nios2_command_shell you can run the command 
"which quartus". This should give you "/path/to/altera_dir/quartus/bin/quartus"


The vhdl code of your submission MUST be placed in the ./vhdl directory. 


The master Makefile starts the whole build process. This includes the quartus
synthesis and download of the sof file to the board as well as the software 
build and download of the ELF file to the nios2 processor. When successful the 
nios2-terminal is started. 
We will ONLY use this Makefile when we check your submission. This means that a
simple make in the project directory must successfully run the aforementioned 
process. So keep in mind that if you change the build environment, this 
"feature" must still be functioning! If you are working on your own computer 
make sure that the build works on the TI lab computers!
